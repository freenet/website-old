      <a name="disclaimer"><h3> 1. A Disclaimer </h3></a>
      <p>
	There are many reasons why people get involved in the Freenet
	Project. Some share the views outlined in this document; some
	share variations of these views, which are also served by what
	we are trying to achieve; and some just enjoy the technical
	challenge. These are the ideas which motivated me to architect
	the system in the first place, but not necessarily the views
	that everyone involved in the Freenet project holds.

      <p>
	For this document to make sense, you should probably know what
	Freenet is. You can get a good overview on
	the <a href="/whatis.html">What is Freenet?</a> page.

      <a name="free_flow_info"><h3> 3. The importance of the Free flow of information  </h3></a>
      
      <p>
	Freedom of speech, in most western cultures, is generally
	considered to be one of the most important rights any
	individual might have. Why is the freedom to share ideas and
	opinions so important? There are several ways to answer this
	question. 
      </p>
      
      <h4> 3.1 Communication is what makes us human </h4>

      <p>
	One of the most obvious differences between mankind and the rest of the
	animal kingdom is our ability to communicate sophisticated and abstract
	concepts. While we constantly discover that animal's communication
	ability is more sophisticated than previously assumed, it is unlikely
	that any other animal approaches our own level of ability in this area.
      </p>
      
      <h4> 3.2 Knowledge is good </h4>
      
      <p>
	Most people, given the option of knowing something and not knowing
	something, will choose to have more information rather than less. Wars
	have been won and lost over who was better-informed. This is because
	being better-informed allows us to make better decisions, and generally
	improve our ability to survive and be successful.
      </p>
      
      <h4> 3.3 Democracy assumes a well informed population </h4>
	
      <p>
	Many people today live under democratic governments, and those who
	don't, probably want to. Democracy is an answer to the question of how
	to create leaders, while preventing them from abusing that power. It
	achieves this by giving the population the power to regulate their
	government through voting, yet the ability to vote does not necessarily
	mean that you live in a democratic country. For a population to
	regulate their government effectively it must know what their
	government is doing, they must be well informed. It is a feedback loop,
	but this loop can be broken if the government has the power to control
	the information the population has access to.
      </p>

      <a name="censor_freedom"><h3> 4. Censorship and freedom </h3></a>

      <p>
	Everyone values their freedom, in fact, many consider it so important
	that they will die for it. People like to think that they are free to
	form and hold whatever opinions they like, particularly in western
	countries. Consider now that someone had the ability to control the
	information you have access to. This would give them the ability to
	manipulate your opinions by hiding some facts from you, by presenting
	you with lies and censoring anything that contradicted those lies. This
	is not some Orwellian fiction, it is standard practice for most western
	governments to lie to their populations, so much so, that people now
	take it for granted, despite the fact that this undermines the very
	democratic principles which justify the government's existence in the
	first place. 
      </p>

      <a name="solution"><h3> 5. The solution </h3></a>

      <p>
	The only way to ensure that a democracy will remain effective
	is to ensure that the government cannot control its
	population's ability to share information, to communicate. So
	long as everything we see and hear is filtered, we are not
	truly free. Freenet's aim is to allow two or more people who
	wish to share information, to do so.
      </p>

      <a name="is_censorship_necessary"><h3> 6. Isn't censorship sometimes necessary? </h3></a>
      <p>
	Of course no issue is black and white, and there are many who feel that
	censorship is a good thing in some circumstances. For example, in some
	European countries propagating information deemed to be racist is
	illegal. Governments seek to prevent people from advocating ideas which
	are deemed damaging to society. There are two answers to this however.
	The first is that you can't allow those in power to impose "good"
	censorship, without also enabling them to impose "bad" censorship. To
	impose any form of censorship a government must have the ability to
	monitor and thus restrict communication. There are already criticisms
	that the anti-racism censorship in many European countries is hampering
	legitimate historical analysis of events such as the second
	world war. 
      </p>

      <p>
	The second argument is that this "good" censorship is
	counter-productive even when it does not leak into other areas. For
	example, it is generally more effective when trying to persuade someone
	of something to present them with the arguments against it, and then
	answer those arguments. Unfortunately, preventing people from being
	aware of the often sophisticated arguments used by racists, makes them
	vulnerable to those arguments when they do eventually
	encounter them. 
      </p>

      <p> 
	Of course the first argument is the stronger one, and would
	still hold-true even if you didn't accept the second. Basically, you
	either have censorship, or you don't. There is no
	middle-ground.
      </p>

      <a name="why_anonymity"><h3> 7. But why is anonymity necessary? </h3></a>

      <p>
	You cannot have freedom of speech without the option to remain
	anonymous. Most censorship is retrospective, it is generally much
	easier to curtail free speech by punishing those who exercise it
	afterward, rather than preventing them from doing it in the first
	place. The only way to prevent this is to remain anonymous. It is a
	common misconception that you cannot trust anonymous information. This
	is not necessarily true, using digital signatures people can create a
	secure anonymous pseudonym which, in time, people can learn to trust.
	Freenet incorporates a mechanism called "subspaces" to facilitate this. 
      </p>
      
      <a name="copyright"><h3> 8. And what of copyright? </h3></a>

      <p>
	Of course much of Freenet's publicity has centered around the issue of
	copyright, and thus I will speak to it briefly. The core problem with
	copyright is that enforcement of it requires monitoring of
	communications, and you cannot be guaranteed free speech if someone is
	monitoring everything you say. This is important, most people fail to
	see or address this point when debating the issue of copyright, so let
	me make it clear:
	<center>You cannot guarantee freedom of speech and enforce
	copyright law</center> 
      </p>
      <p>
	It is for this reason that Freenet, a system designed to
	protect Freedom of Speech, must prevent enforcement of
	copyright.
      </p>

      <a name="reward"><h3> 9. But how will artists be rewarded for their work without copyright? </h3></a>
      
      <p>
	Firstly, even if copyright were the only way that artists could be
	rewarded for their work, then I would contend that freedom is more
	important than having professional artists (those who claim that we
	would have no art do not understand creativity: people will always
	create, it is a compulsion, the only question is whether they can do it
	for a living).
      </p>
      <p>
	Secondly, it could be questioned whether copyright is
	effective even now. The music industry is one of the most vocally
	opposed to enhancements in communication technology, yet according to
	many of the artists who should be rewarded by copyright, it is failing
	to do so. Rather it has allowed middle-men to gain control over the
	mechanisms of distribution, to the detriment of both artists and the
	public.
      </p>
      
      <a name="alternative"><h3> 10. Alternatives to Copyright </h3></a>
      
      <p>
	Fortunately it won't come to this. There are many alternative ways to
	reward artists. The simplest is voluntary payment. This is an extension
	of the patronage system which was frequently used to reward artists
	prior to copyright, where a wealthy person would fund an artist to
	allow them to create full-time. The Internet permits an interesting
	extension of this idea, where rather than having just one wealthy
	patron, you could have hundreds of thousands, contributing small
	amounts of money over the Internet.
      </p>
      <p> 
	We actually practice what we preach in this regard too, on the
	15th of March 2001 the Freenet Project started taking donations, and
	within a week we had collected over $1000.
