      <h3>Code source</h3>
      
      <p>
	We are using <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> as our
	source code management system, hosted
	on <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>. We have many
	different git repositories for the website, freenet itself (fred),
	official plugins, the two installers, libraries and so on; 
	for the list, see <a href="https://github.com/freenet/">our page on github</a>.
	
      </p>

      <p>
	We strongly recommend that you use the official command-line git client,
	or the Windows port. If you want to use the Eclipse git integration, see
	the
	tutorial <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide">here</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>You can obtain the latest source code from git using the following command line:</p>
      <pre>
	git clone git://github.com/freenet/fred.git</pre>

      <p>Once you have cloned the repository, to get new changes you should do:</p>
      <pre>
	git pull origin</pre>

      <p>
    More information on how to use git is further down this page.
      </p>

      <p>
	Git is a distributed revision control system, this means
	amongst other things:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>Everyone has a full copy of the repository, including all the history.</li>
	<li>Branching and merging is easy.</li>
	<li>Working offline (e.g. on a train) is easy.</li>
	<li>We are much less vulnerable to compromise or failure of a central server.</li>
	<li>Anonymous contribution over Freenet is much easier.</li>
	<li>Generally a more secure workflow.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
	We have divided the code up into many sub-projects, each of which has two
	repositories: the -staging repository, which has the latest code, to which
	any developer can write, and the -official repository, which contains code
	which has been reviewed by trusted developers. This is for security, because
	we give out developer rights without any real checking, and because git 
	allows destruction of old history. Stable builds are released from the official
	repository, and the responsible developer will create a signed tag, which you 
	can verify, for that build.
      </p>

      <p>
	Most other projects using github use a different model, where a trusted 
	maintainer pulls from other people's trees, rather than allowing any developer
	to commit to a staging area; if you fork our code, and would like us to merge
	your changes (maybe even over Freenet, but there will be additional checks in 
	this case: for legal reasons we must be certain that anonymous contributions 
	are your own work), feel free to contact us!
      </p>

      <p>
	To get write access to the repository you should create a
	github account and then contact us either through
	the <a href="https://emu.freenetproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/devl">development
	mailing list</a> or
	on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a>
	in
	the <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/%23freenet">#freenet</a>
	channel at irc.freenode.net.Note that you must use a real
	(working) email address when committing; we will provide
	contributors with @freenetproject.org redirects.

      <h3>Build Instructions</h3>
      
      <p>To build the source code you will need <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache ANT</a>.</p>
      
      <h3>Full Build</h3>
      
      <p>
	Building Fred (the Freenet reference daemon) with ant will pull in
	freenet-ext.jar for third party dependancies from the website. To build
	freenet-ext.jar yourself you need to get the contrib module, build it, and put it into
	lib/freenet-ext.jar before you build the main project. Note also that the
	contrib module contains a number of native libraries used to improve 
	performance; you may also want to rebuild these.
      </p>
      <p>
	Plugins, installers etc can generally be built with ant, but some 
	libraries may be written in other languages and have their own building 
	procedures.
      </p>

      <h3>Basic git workflow</h3>
      <p>To pull all changes to the repository:</p>
      
      <pre>
	git pull origin</pre>

      <p>
	Or if you want to review the changes before you merge them into your
	local repository:
      </p>

      <pre>
	git fetch origin
	git log -p -M --ignore-space-change master..origin/master</pre>

      <p>
	If you are happy with the changes, then either merge your local changes
	into the remote changes:
      </p>

      <pre>
	git rebase origin/master</pre>
      <p>Or merge the remote changes into your local repository:</p>
      <pre>
	git merge origin/master</pre>
      <p>The latter will result in a non-linear history, so you should use rebase
	unless your local changes are very large.</p>
      <p>To commit your local changes to your local repository:</p>

      <pre>
	git commit -a</pre>
      <p>Or:</p>
      <pre>
	git commit [ filenames you want to commit ]</pre>
      <p>To upload your changes (assuming you have cloned the -staging tree):</p>
      <pre>
	git push origin</pre>
      <p>To view recent changes:</p>
      <pre>
	git log -p -M --ignore-space-change</pre>
      <p>To undo one or more local commits, assuming you have not pushed your 
	changes, and have not merged remote changes (this will simply reset your
	local repository to a previous version, getting rid of everything since 
	then):</p>
      <pre>
	git reset [ last good revision ]</pre>

      <p>Or if you have committed your change, you will need to revert it:</p>
      <pre>
	git revert [ revision to get rid of ]</pre>
      <p>
	More documentation for git can be found <a href="http://git-scm.com/documentation">here</a>
	or <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
	If you don't like a commit, generally you should post to the devl 
	<a href="lists.html">mailing list</a>. You should CC the author of the 
	commit, but unless it is a trivial matter you should always
	mail devl.
      </p>
